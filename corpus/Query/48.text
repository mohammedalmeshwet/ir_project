Information retrieval is still such a new and experimental field that a line distinguishing research and practice is often difficult - even impossible - to draw.  Are there, however, actual centers of research on information retrieval?  If so, in which countries are they located?  Who supports them - government, business, universities, or libraries?  Can information retrieval as a specialized research discipline be said to be emerging, or is it still an amalgam of skills from other fields, such as mathematics, engineering, and library science?  In other words, tell me about information retrieval research.
