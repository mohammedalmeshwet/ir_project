Is there any established means at present for an international exchange of material about information retrieval?  If there is, does it take the form of an international agency or center which regularly distributes information retrieval methods and research results?  If there is not, in what ways has this material crossed national boundaries?  What seem to have been some of the problems blocking a better international exchange, and is any effort being made to solve some of those problems?
