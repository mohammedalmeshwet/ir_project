A fast algorithm is described for comparing the lists of terms representing documents in automatic classification experiments.  The speed of the procedure arises from the fact that all of the non-zero-valued coefficicents for a given document are identified together, using an inverted file to the terms in the document collection.  The complexity and running time of the algorithm are compared with previously described procedures.
